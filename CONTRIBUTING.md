Contributing Guidelines
=======================

First of all, **thank you** for contributing, **you are awesome**!

Before starting, you should read, agree to, and follow these three things:

* [How to contribute?](#how-to-contribute)
* [Pull Request Guidelines](#pull-request-guidelines)
* [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)

## How to contribute?

### Report Bugs

Report bugs at: https://github.com/TailorDev/crick/issues/new.

When reporting a bug, please include:

* Any details about your local setup which might be helpful in troubleshooting
* Detailed steps to reproduce the bug. Where possible, please write a test case

If you are not able to do that, that's fine! Open an issue anyway and let us
know as much information as you can. We will get back to you to determine the
problem, and (hopefully) fix it.

### Fix Bugs

Check out the [open bugs](https://github.com/TailorDev/crick/issues) - anything
tagged with the **[easy pick]** label could be a good choice for newcomers (and
we are willing to help you).

We have two kind of bugs: **[critical]** and **[bug]**. We tend to fix critical
bugs as soon as possible. Feel free to come up with a patch before we do though!

### Implement Features

Look through the GitHub issues for features. Anything tagged with
**[improvement]** or **[feature]** is open to whoever wants to implement it.

If the issue is unclear or you are not sure what is expected, ask for more
information by commenting on the issue.

### Submit Feedback

Any issue with the **[question]** label is open for feedback, so feel free to
share your thoughts with us!

The best way to send feedback is to [create a new
issue](https://github.com/TailorDev/crick/issues/new) on GitHub.

If you are proposing a feature:

* Explain how you envision it working. Try to be as detailed as you can
* Try to keep the scope as narrow as possible. This will help make it easier to
  implement
* Feel free to include any code you might already have, even if it is
  just a rough idea. This is a volunteer-driven project, and contributions are
  welcome :)

Your issue will be flagged as **[feature request]** first, and if we agree on
it, we will label it as **[feature]**, meaning it has been accepted and the
feature will eventually be added to the project.

## Pull Request Guidelines

Here are a few rules to follow in order to make code reviews and discussions go
more smoothly before maintainers accept and merge your work:

* you MUST run the test suite
* you MUST write (or update) unit tests
* you SHOULD write documentation

Please, write [commit messages that make
sense](http://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html),
and [rebase your branch](http://git-scm.com/book/en/Git-Branching-Rebasing)
before submitting your Pull Request.

You may be asked to [squash your
commits](http://gitready.com/advanced/2009/02/10/squashing-commits-with-rebase.html)
too. This is to "clean" your Pull Request before merging it (we don't want
commits such as `fix tests`, `fix 2`, `fix 3`, etc.).

Also, while creating your Pull Request on GitHub, you MUST write a description
which gives the context and/or explains why you are creating it.

For further information about creating a Pull Request, please read [this blog
post](http://williamdurand.fr/2013/11/20/on-creating-pull-requests/).

Thank you!
